<h1>What is <em>College Rank</em>?</h1>
<p class="body">
<em>College Rank</em> is an iPhone app built to help a prospective college student choose a place of higher learning. By personalizing the algorithm to decide which college is best for you, <em>College Rank</em> lets you be in control! Add your own custom preferences to personalize your choice even further!  <em>College Rank</em> will help you determine which college best fits your personal preferences. </p>

<h1><em>Colleges</em> Tab</h1>
<h2><strong>How do I add a college or university?</strong></h2>
<p> Use the search bar to find and select potential colleges and universities that interest you. Select a college from the drop-down list generated by the search. The search term you enter will match any part of the name of a college. You may also search by zip code, if that is easier for you.</p>
<h2><strong>How do I remove a college or university from my list?</strong></h2>
<p> If you wish to remove a college after adding it, click the <em>Edit</em> button in the top-left corner then click the red circle that appears next to the college you wish to remove. Click the <em>Delete</em> button that appears next to the college to complete removing that college from your list.</p>
<h2><strong>I&rsquo;ve made my selection of colleges and universities. Now what?</strong></h2>
<p>  After you have selected at least 2 and at most 10 colleges, continue on to the <em>Preferences</em> tab.
</p>
<h1><em>Preferences </em>Tab</h1>
<h2><strong>How do I add a preference?</strong></h2>
<p> Use the search bar to find and select factors that influence your choice of college. <em>College Rank</em> provides you with 17 built-in factors, with the option of adding your own custom preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>How do I add a built-in preference?</strong></h2>
 <p>To add a built-in preference, click on one of the built-in preference&rsquo;s name in the search bar&rsquo;s drop-down list. If there is any missing data from the <em>College Rank</em> database, you will be prompted to fill in this data for the colleges and universities you have selected. If you do not know this data or do not want to guess at it, then simply click the <em>Next</em> button at the bottom of the screen. Continuing on with missing data will skew end results a little bit, so it is always better to fill in missing data if you have the chance.<br />
   After filling in missing data (if there is any), you will be prompted to choose your personal preference for the factor you added. For example, if you choose <em>City Size</em>, then you will be prompted to choose what type of city best suites your preference for a college. Choose one of the options and hit <em>Save </em>to complete the process of adding a preference.
 </p>
<h2><strong>How do I add a custom preference?</strong></h2>
<p> To add a custom preference, select <em>Custom</em> from the search bar&rsquo;s drop-down list. You will then be prompted to provide a name so that <em>College Rank</em> may keep track of your preference. The next screen will provide you with markers that represent your feelings about how well certain colleges fit your preferences for your custom preference. Drag and drop these markers onto the line to tell <em>College Rank</em> how well the college fits your preference. The best colleges go at the top of the line, while the college that least fit your preference go at the bottom. It is perfectly acceptable for you to put college on top of one another. After you have finished, click the <em>Save</em> button to complete the process of adding a custom preference.</p>
<h2><strong>How do I change the weight of a preference?</strong></h2>
<p> To change the weight of a preference, select the name of the preference underneath the slider. Then use the slider to increase or decrease the weight that the preference holds in your choice of a college. The pie chart above the slider will update accordingly, illustrating the relationship of weights between the preferences you have selected.</p>
<h2><strong>How do I removing a preference?</strong></h2>
<p> If you wish to remove a preference from your list, click the <em>Edit</em> button in the top-left corner of the screen, then hit the red circle that appears next to the name of the preference you wish to remove. Finally, click the red <em>Delete</em> button that appears next to the name of the preference to complete the process of removing a preference.</p>
<h2><strong>I&rsquo;m done adding preferences and setting their weights. Now what?</strong></h2>
<p>  After you have added at least 2 and no more than 10 preferences, click the <em>Rankings</em> at the bottom of the screen to view your final rankings.</p>
<h1><em>Rankings</em> Tab</h1>
<h2><strong>What does this bar chart mean?</strong></h2>
<p>  The bar chart gives a visual representation of a college&rsquo;s <em>cardinal utility</em> to your preferences based on what you entered in the previous two tabs. In short, it tells you how well a college fits into your personal views on what a great college should be. The bars in the chart are ordered in descending order and are color-coated with the list below it. The bar chart gives a great visual representation of how much better one college is than another, according to your preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>What about this list?</strong></h2>
<p>  The list simply gives an ordering to the colleges and universities you selected based on your preferences. Note that some colleges may be tied with one another.</p>
<h2><strong>Can I go back and change my selected colleges and preferences?</strong></h2>
<p>  Of course. That&rsquo;s the entire point of <em>College Rank</em>! Go back to the other tabs to modify your lists of colleges and preferences. See how different weights affect final outcomes. Add more custom preferences to more accurately represent your final decision in selecting a college. Good luck and have fun!</p>
